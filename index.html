	  <h3> February 2011</h3>
	  <p align="left">A a bored George, about to move to Southern
	    Georgia, decides to do a global search for "best match" on a
	    popular dating site. On the first page of results is a woman
	    with almost the same username (a reference to the well-known
	    computer
	    scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger
	      Dijkstra</a>). He decides to send a message:</p>
	  <p align="left">
	    <strong>Feb 2, 2011 - 6:44pm</strong>
	    <br />
	    <em>
	      I just wanted to apologize for all the quick-and-dirty hacks I've ever committed. (I didn't know any better; I'm only an engineer.)
	    </em>
	  </p>
	  <h3> Meanwhile... </h3>
	  <p align= "left">One of Elaine's best friends, tired of the
	  single life, has decided to sign up for a popular online
	  dating site, but not alone&mdash;Elaine finds herself
	  convinced to make an account, "just to keep me company". Less than two weeks later, Elaine
	  receives a message from a mysterious engineer with nearly
	  the same username as her. Sensing someone who might be up
	  for some banter (and, ugh, he's cute too), she replies:</p>
	  <p align="left"><strong>Feb 2, 2011 - 8:02pm</strong>
	    <br />
	    <em>
	      Oh, I know about you engineers -- I'm related to one and
	      he writes the most painful-to-read code ever (why are ALL your
	      variables
	      global???) 
	    </em>
	    [Ed.: Sorry,
	    Dale!]
	    <em>. 
	      On the bright side, engineers are much less likely to get caught up in "I will implement this in the most general way possible" and end up only finishing half of what they set out to do (not that I have ever done such a thing, of course).
	    </em>
	  </p>
	  <h3>A few weeks (and one nail-bitingly long gap in George's
	  messages, thanks to that move) later, we know: </h3>
	  <p align="left">
	    <ol align="left" style="list-style-type:circle">
	      <li>Elaine and George both enjoy pretentious references, snappy wit, grandiose vocabulary, and all things computer-related.
              </li>
	      <li>Despite living 2,500 miles apart on opposite sides of the country, their hometowns are less than a five-hour's drive apart in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York.
              </li>
	      <li>Elaine is going to be in Georgia for the summer for a research internship and George owes her a drink (in exchange for the rights to use one of her cleverer lines).
              </li>
	      <li>... but George is going to be underway for the entire summer; there's no way they can meet up while Elaine is in Georgia.
              </li>
	      <li>They can't quite bring themselves to let this chance slip away.
          </li></ol></p>
	  <h3> April 2011 </h3>
	  <p align="left">
	    Fortunately for everyone involved, Elaine has a bit of a
	    taste for adventure [Ed.: Sorry, Mom!], and suggests meeting up in Austin,
	    Texas, almost exactly halfway between Los Angeles and
	    Saint Marys. Rooms are reserved at a
	    grad-student-budget-friendly motel on the outskirts of
	    downtown Austin, plane tickets are purchased, and April
	    1st, 2011 (yes, April Fool's Day) finds Elaine sitting
	    outside a gate in the Delta terminal of the Austin
	    airport, frantically drawing robots in a futile attempt to
	    calm her nerves.
	  </p>
	  <p align="left">
	    George steps off the plane looking even more engineer-ish
	    than usual, but Elaine is charmed anyway. They hold hands in the
	    taxi to the hotel, and spend the next day walking around
	  Austin, still hand-in-hand. Less than a week after their trip, they decide to
	    give a relationship a try.
	  </p>
	  <h3>March 2015</h3>
	  <p align="left">
	    After four years, sixty thousand frequent flier miles,
	    five 3-month stretches underway, more than 400 emails,
	    endless video calls and chatting, one cross-country move,
	    a shared lease, and two cats, they decide it's time to get
	    married.

	    <h2>Hooray! How do I get there?</h2>
	  </header>

   
 <h3>By Car</h3>
    <p>For most guests, the easiest way to get to State College will
    be by car.  State College is <a
    href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Unitarian+Universalist+Fellowship+of+Centre+County,+780+Waupelani+Drive,+State+College,+PA+16801/@40.7719357,-77.8893575,8z">smack
    dab in the middle of Pennsylvania</a> which puts it within about a
    four- to five-hour drive from NYC, Shortsville, or DC.</p>

	   <h3>By Plane</h3>
	  <p> There are 
    <a
    href="https://www.google.com/flights/#search;t=SCE;d=2016-07-22;r=2016-07-24">direct
    flights to State College</a> from Philadelphia (US Airways), Washington Dulles and
    Chicago O'Hare (United), and Detroit (Delta).  The closest major
    airports are BWI (a 3.5 hour drive), Pittsburgh (2.5 hours), and
    Newark (3.5 hours).</p>

	  <h3> By Public Transit</h3>
	  <p> You'll probably want to drive to get around State College,
	  but if you have friends or family who will have a car, you
	  can get to State College by train (<a href="http://www.amtrak.com/home">Amtrak</a> to Lewistown or
	  Altoona) or bus (<a href="http://us.megabus.com">Megabus</a>
	  has a route between Chicago and New York that stops in State
	  College, or you can take one of a couple Chinatown bus
	  services from NYC)</p>

	  <h3>By Canoe or Kayak</h3>
	  <p> Spring Creek connects to the Susquehanna River, so guests
	  coming from points south and east of State College could
	  (with a few minor portages) paddle their way to the
	  wedding. We suggest that guests choosing this means of
	  transport leave a few extra days or weeks for travel, depending on
	  paddling speed.  You can search "water trails" <a
	  href="http://www.explorepatrails.com/gm_trails.aspx">here</a>
	  for maps and additional information.</p>

	  <h3>By Foot</h3>
	  <p>Pennsylvania is a state rich in public land, so guests
	  wishing to make their way to State College on foot will find
	  many options for senic trails. There are <a
	  href="http://www.explorepatrails.com/gm_trails.aspx">many
	  trails</a> covering the state, but the best option for most
	  guests would be the <a
	  href="http://www.pahikes.com/trails/mid-state-trail">Mid-State
	  trail</a> (<a
	  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_State_Trail_%28Pennsylvania%29">wikipedia
	  page</a>) which passes the outskirts of State College, and forms part of the <a
	  href="http://www.greateasterntrail.net">Great Eastern Trail</a>, which
	  connects both with the <a
	  href="http://www.fltconference.org/trail/go-hiking/interactive-map-segmented/">Finger
	  Lakes Trail</a> (a trail stretching
	  to the southern end of Canandaigua Lake), and (indirectly) with the <a
	  href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org">Appalachian
	  Trail</a>.  As with those guests arriving by water, please
	  be sure you leave enough time to make your journey!</p>
